This started as a pretty simple mod thrown together in a few minutes for trentomento that straps a BOMB (fuel array) to EVERY enemy that spawns. Has tons of customization options to make your gameplay very fun for everyone. Send any bug reports to @egg8929 in the risk of rain mod dev discord in #tech-support
